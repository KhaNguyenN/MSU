## ComputerScience1 (CS1)
## ComputerScience2 (CS2)
## Softwaretools and Development (CS3250)
We worked for a product owner and 10 teams including ourselves. Of groups of five to seven. Using an Agile workflow, while switching roles of at least a Scrum Lord and Product Manager while the rest are dev ops. Switching each sprint, while trying to maintain and adhere to the product owner's specification. [Final Project Website Development](https://bitbucket.org/clarkdollard/cwmt/src/master/)
## Functional Programming (CS390V)
In functional Programming we work to understand how to use functional programming to better understand data structures. We worked from working with Akka, Elixir, and other functional languages to get a better understanding towards computation.

## Digital Image Processing (CS390S)
We got the option to either work by ourselves or with one extra person for our final project. I Chose to opt in with another person to work on a project that takes an image and then pull out its most important features.

## Technical Software Project (CS4360)
We worked on the either the product of the product owner, or a product of our choosing with the approval of the professor. We chose to work in a group of 4, that worked on a mole detection application that could either detect if the mole was either benign or malignant using machine learning.
